## What has happened here?

As of July 12th 2023, the discord formerly known as "Forgecord" was rebranded to a new project - NeoForged.

NeoForged is a fork of MinecraftForge. Almost all of the original team has joined the new team, with one 
obvious exception, LexManos (hereby referred to as Lex).

This news post will attempt to explain the circumstances leading to this drastic action. It presents the 
perspective of the new team however, and specifically, my (cpw) perspective and motivations.

## Why did this happen?

Firstly, I want to be clear. Attributing this to a single event is to attribute death by a thousand cuts to a
single cut.

After the latest difficulties in the Minecraft Forge discord, I wanted to understand why Curle felt she needed
to resign from the position Lex put her in - namely, leader of the project. She had done an amazing job of
organizing the team prior to the promotion to leader, and it was surprising to me that she felt the need to
leave so shortly after. The discussion with her opened my eyes to the fact that there had been ongoing 
difficulties with the team she had spent so much time to build, and Lex was the root of the problem.

I want to be clear, Lex has been a problem in the modding community for _many_, _many_ years. Almost every 
veteran minecraft modder has had a negative interaction with him over the past 12 years. I have, when able to,
tried to steer people to not abandon Forge just because of Lex - defending him in many a private
conversation with a frustrated modder who'd just been called a Cunt for 1,000th time by Lex, or banned from 
our online spaces for a trivial transgression like discussing Fabric or coremods.

In evaluating the situation I was in, it quickly became clear I could take one of three actions:
1. Do nothing. If I did nothing, I believe we would be watching the slow disintegration of the Forge project. 
This is why we recruited Curle in the first place - to try and help build a useful team, that would enable Lex to 
step back from the limelight and community management aspects. Her departure would cement that the Forge team
was too toxic to continue to function in a viable capacity, in my opinion. We would have seen more public 
disputes and abuse, with more modders and community leaders becoming increasingly frustrated.
2. Babysit Lex. In effect, this is what I have been doing, to a more or lesser extent, for the past 10 years. He 
would not see it that way, but I have been defending Lex to all comers for many many years. I truly thought that
if he could stop being so toxic online, we would become successful.
3. Do what we have done - fork the project and start afresh. 

Note that due to personal physical and mental health issues, I was not well enough to continue with 2 and
have rather withdrawn from the community - effectively 1 - because I needed to preserve my health. Lex has argued
repeatedly that I had the power to rein him in, but that's an accident of history and not something that I believe
should have been necessary between two adult friends, and if it had killed me - a non-zero likelihood (I am not a 
young man) - then there would have been no one left anyway.

## We have forked

Yes, we have forked the project. Curle and I both agreed this was the best decision for the future of the project and
more importantly for the community - I never wanted the money or the power that comes with being leader and we
have rather started the process of putting together a simple consitution for the project moving forward, which
we will be sharing as time allows.

We have _had_ to fork - because many of the core assets are licensed by Lex's company Forge LLC. It is better for
us to fork and rebrand. We will be removing those assets that are part of the MinecraftForge project, as we develop
our own brand and styling.

Note that this is not a _hard fork_ yet. We remain compatible with existing Forge for the present time. Whether we break that
compatilibity in the future is one of many topics of discussion. Some want us to quickly clean up the technical debt,
others feel that we should take a more measured approach to that effort. Suffice to say, both opinions have some merit
and we encourage discussion and adult debate about what measures are appropriate on what timescales.

## Why did this seem so rushed?

We had been in planning and discussion for around 9 days - and had a private discord setup where we could discuss the
future direction and do work on initial setup and planning. This was well underway when I received the shock of my life
yesterday morning - for who but Lex themselves was in our private discord, reading the backlog. The reasons for this
are still unclear, and we'll likely never know the full extent of what happened, but suffice to say, the cat was 
_definitely_ out of the bag.

Faced with an unknown quantity, we felt that we had to act to quickly preserve the community, rather than risk all that
has been built, especially in the past two years. Thus we launched our rebrand, before we were truly ready, but it was in
effort to preserve the community.

## Why did you take the discord?

The discord was always mine. I set it up very early on in discord's life, originally as an experiment, but when it 
became clear that discord was getting popular, I suggested to Lex that we transition it to our new online space. At first
it was secondary to #minecraftforge on esper.net IRC, but over time, it became the primary community hub. Lex was never 
interested in taking ownership of the server, even though I offered it several times. So it is my asset, and as my 
asset, I felt it best to rebrand it.

## What happens now?

Things will settle as time passes. We should have our governance documents soon - we have good plans for a fresh approach
to governing the project. We have had **many** **_many_** offers of support and help from many many community members,
including corporations that run large hosting providers, distribution platforms and more. We will be setting up an
opencollective for those that wish to financially support the project. That financial support will be funneled directly 
back into the project - we hope to be able to help our many contributors with a little pocket money for their kind 
donations of time.

## My opinion and perspective
I want to be clear, this is my opinion and perspective. Others will have their own opinions, and they may differ in the 
details, but I believe this is the best possible future for the project as a whole.

I hope curle will write her perspective on the matter for publishing here.
